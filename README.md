# Bonus Program - The Farmer's Market

<p>The purpose of this  exercise is to create a program computes the total cost (with tax) of fresh  produce purchased at the farmers market.  </p>
<p>Apples, eggplants,  peaches, peppers, and tomatoes are stocked and cost 50 cents, 75 cents, 25  cents, 60 cents and 80 cents each, respectively.</p>
<p>Create an array that holds  the names of the produce.  Create another  array to hold the cost of each corresponding item.   Your program should input the name of the  fruit and the quantity purchased and output which produce was purchased and the  total cost of the sale.  </p>
<p>Remember to use  FormatCurrency to output the final cost.</p>
<p><strong>In this exercise, you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an  algorithm</li>
  <li>Work with  adding Controls to a Visual Basic Form</li>
  <li>Declare and  Assign values to Variables</li>
  <li>Use a Constant  Variable</li>
  <li>Cast Inputs to  appropriate data types</li>
  <li>Use arithmetic  operations</li>
  <li>Use Decision  making concepts</li>
  <li>Use parallel  arrays to store data</li>
  <li>Use textboxes  to input information</li>
  <li>Use a listbox  to output information</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Before your  Code:  Create the algorithm</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify inputs </li>
    <li>Identify the steps in your process </li>
    <li>Identify outputs (Items purchased and total cost) </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new Visual Basic Windows Forms Application  named &lsquo;TheFarmersMarket&rsquo; and save it to your i:drive
  </li>
  <li>Design your  form by adding the necessary controls.   Play with the control properties to change colors/backgrounds.
  </li>
  <li>Write the code to create the arrays as needed and  calculate the total cost.
  </li>
  <li>Output the items purchased and total cost to a  listbox. </li>

  <li>Spruce up your form by adding a picture box with a  relevant image </li>

  <li>Save All,  Compile and Run Your Form</li>
  <li>Upload the  completed assignment to GitHub classroom.</li>
</ol>
